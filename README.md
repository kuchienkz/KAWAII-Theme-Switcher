# KAWAII Theme Switcher
A small tool for Windows Theme enthusiast.

Use this app to switch between Windows themes with just One click! Plus, without showing any dialog! Yup. 
KTS (in shorts), will scan your /Resources/Themes folder for .theme files and save each file's path for later.

# Installation
NO NEED for installation! Since this guy doesn't have any GUI, just put the EXE somewhere nice, Thats all!

# Extra Features
Well, in order to enable some features, you need to do some stuff, but don't worry, i will keep it simple and clean!

- To launch this tool on every Startup
Inside the folder where you put the EXE, create a text file named "startup.txt". Open it, write "delay: 10000", make sure you wrote it on the first line. save and close. Lastly, launch the EXE, it will automatically create a shortcut on your startup folder. What about the "Delay"? Thats a delay before changing your theme when it launch on startup, in Milliseconds. So, 10000 means 10 seconds delay before changing theme. Of course you may modify this.
